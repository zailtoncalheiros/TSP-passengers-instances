# TSPLIB Instances

This instance group contains problems with graphs obtained at [TSPLIB](https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/).

Every instance contains one passenger per vertice with uniformly randomized destination. Also, each passenger contains a fee that varies between 20%, 25%, 33% from minimum spanning tree.

It contains two main sub-classes: symmetric and asymmetric.
